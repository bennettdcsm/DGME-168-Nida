      <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
      <p>I like making creative things with Illustrator and Canva. I design logos, graphics, and page layouts for both web and print. I enjoy choosing nice colors, good fonts, and clean styles. Design helps me show ideas in a clear and beautiful way. It makes me happy to create something people enjoy looking at.</p>

      <h2>UI/UX Design</h2>
      <p>I care about how people use websites and apps. I make wireframes, mockups, and simple prototypes to show how the design works. I always try to think like the user. My goal is to make designs easy to understand, nice to look at, and simple to use. I enjoy solving problems and improving the experience.</p>

      <h2>Video Production</h2>
      <p>I use Premiere Pro to make videos that look good and tell a story. I know how to cut clips, add music, fix colors, and make smooth transitions. I like editing videos and making everything work well together. I enjoy sharing ideas with video because itâ€™s a powerful way to connect with people.</p>
